# units-list
This is somewhat outdated, I'll update it later.
A simple library oriented around providing easy and usable string-based units while still remaining extensible. Tries to be both simpler than the `units` package, and be more extensible than the `dimensional` package.
## Example

    worldPopulationInBillions = dimension "billion*people" 8.142
    worldPopulation = fmap floor $ applyPos "billion" (*1e9) worldPopulationInBillions
    daysInYear = dimension "days/years" 365
    caloriePerDay = dimension "calories/days/people" 2000    
    caloriesPerYear = caloriePerDay !* daysInYear !* worldPopulation 
    > 5943659999270000 calories / years
Since everything has units, I chose `Symbols` to be the core dimensional type of this project.
## Debug tip:
When getting an error like `Could not match kind symbol with *` in a polymorphic function like this `assertSame :: Dimension n a -> Dimension n a -> Dimension n a`, Try changing the type signature to `assertSame :: forall k a (n :: [(k,Int')]). Dimension n a -> Dimension n a -> Dimension n a`. This happened once, please report any other problems/solutions to ashok.kimmel@gmail.com, so I can add them to this README.   
## Implementation
A dimension is difined quite simply as: 

    type Dimension :: forall k. [(k,Int')] -> Type -> Type 
    newtype Dimension a b = MkDimension b
        deriving stock (Eq,Ord,Functor)

There are two invariants: The `Int'` should never be zero, and the `Dimension` should be ordered. This means that there is only 1 valid type that satisfies the invariants per dimension.

`k` represents the kind used to index dimensions. One example is `Symbols`, another would be a `Metric` kind, another might be `CaseInsenstiveStrings`,etc. 
`Int'` represents the datatype used in this repository to represent `Integers`. 

    data Int' = Pos Nat | Neg Nat 
    
`Neg n` represents `-(n+1)`. 
If you really need to create a dimension, you are encouraged to use `ToNegInt` and `ToPosInt` from `Numeric.Dimension.TypeLevelInt`, as implementation may change.
## Creation
There are 8 ways to create dimensions


    dim :: b -> forall a ->  Dimension (ValidParse @Symbol a) b 
    dims ::Functor f => f b -> forall a ->  f (Dimension (ValidParse @Symbol a) b) 
    dimension :: forall a -> forall b. b -> Dimension (ValidParse @Symbol a)  b
    dimensions :: forall a -> forall f b. Functor f => f b -> f (Dimension (ValidParse @Symbol a) b)
    dimensionPoly :: forall a -> forall b.  b -> Dimension (ValidParse a) b 
    dimensionsPoly :: forall a -> forall f b. Functor f => f b -> f (Dimension (ValidParse a) b) 
    dimNP :: forall a -> forall b. b -> Dimension (Format a) b
    dimNPs :: forall a -> forall f b. Functor f => f b -> f (Dimension (Format a) b)

`dim`,`dims`,`dimension` and `dimensions` are the most common ones. They only work on symbols however, so if you want to use a different base, they would fail. `dim` and `dims` are like their longer counterparts just with the arguments flipped. `dimensions` is just dimension but lifted over a functor. Inspired by the ReadMe for the `Dimensional`  library. The polymorphic versions suffer from type ambiguity as the kind of the resulting `Dimension` is unknown. It is reccomended that you add a wrapper if you plan to use a seperate dimension. `dimNP` is if you don't want to use the built in parser and want to manually specify the dimensions. 
### Note on parser
The parser is very simple: 
it checks for `*`,and `/`, splits them into sections,
checks for `^` in the subsections and creates the dimensions accordingly.
As a result, all of the following are valid

    :k! Parse "*******" -> ['("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Pos 1),'("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Pos 1),'("", TI.Pos 1)]
    :k! Parse "*/*/***^201" -> ['("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Neg 0),'("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Neg 0), '("", TI.Pos 1), '("", TI.Pos 1),'("", TI.Pos 201)]
    :k! Parse "second/(meter*kilogram)"  -> [("kilogram),Pos 1),("(meter",Neg 0),("second",Pos 1)] 

`dimension` ensures that the invariants are upheld, but still allows annoyances. Check the types!
Given the annoyance inherent to type level coding, this may not change.

### Note on printer
The printer will not print the actual type as it is stored. e.g. 

    dimension "second/meter" 2 -> 2 second/meter

Despite the fact that the ordering of meter is actually before second, the printer tries to print the positive dimensions first. A useful note for debugging type errors.

## Multiplying,dision,etc.

`!+`,`!-`,`!*`,`!/`,`divD` can be used for multiplying and dividing dimensions. 
They are mostly just specialized forms of `liftD2`, which works on two of the same and `combineD2`, which multiplies the two types. 
`rt`,`rtn`,`!^`,`!^^` all allow for exponentiation and roots. They need type level arguments. `rt`,`!^^` work on `Int'`s, while `rt` and `!^` work on `Nat`s.  
The type families `!*`,`!/`,`RT`,`RTN` all work at the type level and can be used with the NoParse functions to avoid parsing.
## Transformations along dimensions

```
transform :: forall s t x a. TT.ToInt (LookupD0 s x) => (a -> a, a -> a) -> Dimension x a -> Dimension (Replace s t x) a 
```
This is used to completely switch a type parameter, whether it shows up in the positive or negative. Common usage would be with prefixes, `kilogram`  to `gram`,etc.

```
transformPos :: forall s t x a. (TL.KnownNat (TI.ToNatural (LookupD0 s x))) => (a -> a) -> Dimension x a -> Dimension (Replace s t x) a
```
Like `transform` but only needs the switch in the positive direction. However, it requries that the dimension only occurs a positive number of times. Useful when you know that your unit occurs in the positive place.

```
apply :: forall x a. forall s -> TT.ToInt (LookupD0 s x) => (a -> a, a -> a) -> Dimension x a -> Dimension (Delete s x) a
```
Like `transform`, but consumes the dimension. Can be useful with things like `billion`, or `mole`.

```
applyPos :: forall x a. forall s -> (TL.KnownNat (TI.ToNatural (LookupD0 s x))) => (a -> a) -> Dimension x a -> Dimension (Delete s x) a
```
`apply` but only needs 1 function. I used this to eliminate the `billion` in the example.

```
same :: forall s t x. (forall a. Dimension x a -> Dimension (Replace s t x) a)
```
Assert that two things are the same, and replace one with another. Example: `g` `gram` `grams` all symbolize the same thing, but some places might use different ones.

```
mkisos :: forall y x a. Dimension x a -> Dimension (Isos y x) a
```
the same as repeated usage of `same`, uses a type level list.

```
inject :: (n -> n) -> forall a -> Dimension b n -> Dimension (a !* b) n
```
Allows you to add a `dimension` to a type, using a function. Example, adding a mole,

    replace :: forall a -> Dimension b n -> Dimension (a !* b) n
    replace = inject id

Replace can be used to replace simple things, even if you don't want to do it multiple times.
Example: `replace (Parse "billion/thousand^3")`

## Extracting dimensions
`undimension`,  requires all tags be eliminated already.

`getDimension` allow you to specify the dimension, and `getDimensionNP` allows you to manually parse things.
## Extending:
To extend this to a non-symbol base kind, define a `ToDimension`(for parsing), `FromDimension` (for printing), and `Compare` (for preserving invariants). Then you should probably define your own `dim`,`dims`,etc. functions and importing that module. The functionality should remain the same. 
You can also use the `MatchAll` class and the `match` function to define custom transformations along `Symbols`. Example: Get rid of all `kilo` prefixes in a dimension.
